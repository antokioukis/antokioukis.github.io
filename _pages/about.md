My name is Antonios Kioukis, I am currently a PhD student enrolled in the Medical School of the University of Crete, Greece researching the "dark matter" of microbial diversity.
For the moment, i am in the middle of the mandatory year-long military service so if you wish to get in contact with me please use email.

Proud member of the minority of bioinfomaticians, which hold a Bachelor at Computer Science and then made the jump into Bioinformatics as opposed to "biologists who code".
Full stack developper of imngs, imngs2, and MSD employing technologies as diverse as django, R and bash pipelines. 

I am a firm believer that specialization is for ants so i am open to work in any data analysis project.


My favorite subreddit is [soccer](https://reddit.com/r/soccer), and since i have not met yet a single person that a hot meat does not make their day better, I also spend my time researching and executing recipes at [cooking](https://reddit.com/r/cooking).
